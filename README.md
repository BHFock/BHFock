## 🐊 Why the Crocodile?

> "Björn, just curious—why the crocodile?"

Someone asked this in a team chat once. I told them about a German management story I'd heard.

Say a manager wants you to move from point A to point B. They could give you a direct command (*the pistol approach*). Or they could put a crocodile at point A. You'll move to B on your own.

The crocodile is about *control through fear* instead of direct orders. German unions talk about this a lot.

The team got into it:
*"So the pistol is better? At least they don't want to shoot you. But the crocodile wants to eat you!"*

I said there's a third way: *"Skip the crocodile—put free food at B instead."*

🍪 *"Any cookie preferences?"* — my manager, who'd been reading along.

I keep the crocodile around as a playful reminder. Better to move toward something good than away from something scary. Plus it makes me smile when I need to get work done.

It sits on my desk now. And here on GitHub.

🫖 Workplace note: No actual crocodiles in the front pond. And we do get tea and biscuits sometimes.
